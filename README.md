# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? To practice writing a more thought out READEME file. 
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") To start my dev career on a solid foundation. 
- What problem does it solve? The lack of expereince I have at this current juncture. 
- What did you learn? I have learned a proper README file is just as important as the code you are writing. 

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)

## Usage

This prework study guide can be used for a basic intro to HTML and JavaScript. This was created to start a foundation of learning and better understand how all these elements work together to form the modern web that we know. 

Each section contains information about Java, CSS, Git. If you were to open the Dev tools console you will see that Java is running a simple script in the background. 


## Credits

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
